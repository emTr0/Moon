Welcome to my new website and blog at emTr0.tv!

I've been working on this website for a little while now. I built it using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), the [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) static website generator and a modified version of the Moon theme for Jekyll by GitHub user [TaylanTatli](https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Moon).

Chances are you've come here because you already follow me on Twitch, Twitter or Instagram. Whether that's how you ended up here, thanks for stopping by! You can learn more about me on my [About](https://emtr0.tv/about) page if you're new to my website or profiles.

This blog will be used to share anything I feel like sharing. Things like Twitch clips, YouTube videos, product recommendations, maybe a new movie or show I'm watching, announcements and more. Right now there's no RSS feed or any other way to sign up for updates but I'll be sharing all new posts on my social media profiles.

If you aren't already connected with me, below are my most active profiles to get you started:

* [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/emtr0)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/emtr0)
* [Instagram](https://instagram.com/emtr0)

Thanks again for stopping by!
