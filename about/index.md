## Intro

I'm Mauricio aka "emTr0" almost everywhere online. I'm 31, from San Diego, California, and enjoy programming in Python and JavaScript (soon!). My online prescence is primarily focused on gaming and streaming on Twitch. Right now I play/stream a lot of Rainbow Six: Siege, Apex Legends and Star Citizen. I'm not a pro, partner or anything like that. I do it because I enjoy sharing the gaming experience, and to capture cool/epic moments for later.

## Background

I started gaming at a very early age, probably 5 or 6, with Nintendo and games like Super Mario and Zelda. From there I progressed to PC gaming with games like Jazz Jackrabbit (loaded off a 5-inch floppy!), Jetpack Christmas Special, Monstertruck Madness, etc. I also had a Sega, Nintendo 64, PlayStation 1 and 2, Xbox and Xbox 360 (later on). My first experience with "true gaming" came with Quake and StarCraft in the late 90s. I was hooked and eventually played their sequals. Fast forward a bit, I got really into Counter-Strike (pre-Steam, pre-CSCZ) and a few other games around the same time. I've spent a bunch of time in World of Warcraft, Diablo and the like as well. Since then, and since Steam's public release, I've played a bunch of different games. Fast forward again, I eventually found out about Twitch and created an account in 2011 but I didn't start streaming till 2017. I first tried streaming on YouTube in 2016 because I thought Twitch was overly saturated but it didn't make a difference, and YouTube didn't offer the customizations I wanted. I switched to Twitch in early/mid 2017 and have been streaming ever since. My early Twitch influencers/inspiration were Dr. Disrespect and Shroud, the true models of entertainment and skill and the platform.

## Today

As I mentioned before, I'm a streamer on Twitch but I also sometimes create content for YouTube. I greatly enjoy FPS games but do play the occasional survival or horror game. I'm also a streamer for <a href="https://worldbest.gg" target="_blank">WorldBestGaming</a>, which includes a variety of streamers for a variety of games, as well as pro players.
